When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    For example when collaborating with others on a project. Or in the case of git hub,
    to receive input from other people, which you might not be able get in contact with 
    otherwise.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Chnages might have been introduced, which I do not want to include in my local version.
    In this case it is better that I can control my local files manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of someone elses code to my profiel. I can edit it without making changes
    to the code of the original owner. However, the fork links back to the original creator of the code.
    A clone is a copy of someone elses code and is separate from the original version. There is no link.
    A branch is an extension/version from an existing code, which can be merged to the master later on.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
